### File Systems (cont.)

* inodes (cont.) 
* MBR (booting)
* FATx - MS-DOS
* UNIX-V7 
* structure of a hard disk
    * shortest seek time first (sstf)

#### RAID Systems

* RAID 0
* RAID 1 
    * mirroring
    * duplexing
* RAID 2 - bit-level striping, too complicated due to the need
  to synchronize hard disks 
* RAID 3 - XOR (reconstructing ), implementation is also very complex
* RAID 4
* RAID 5
* RAID 6 - like RAID 5 but wwith reed-solomon codes instead of XOR.
