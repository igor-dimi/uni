### How to Represent Graphs 

* **Nodes**: whole numbers 0, ..., N - 1 (or keys related to the application, e.g. Names)
* **Edges**: Two options
  1. **Adjacency matrix**:  
     $A \in \{0, 1\}^{|V| \times |V|}$, s.t. $a_{i, j} = 1 \Leftrightarrow \text{edge} i \rightarrow j \text{exixts}$ 

     for an undirected graph: $A = A^T$ (matri has to be symmetric)

     example:

     ![adjecency matrix](./imgs/w12/adjacency-matrix.png){width="75%"}

     advantages:

     * concepts and techniques can be directly applied
     * storage efficient for direct graphs that are not sparse, i.e. $|E| \in \mathcal{O}(|V|^2)$, (but not for sparse graphs $|E| \in \mathcal{O(|V|)}$)

  2. **Adjacency list**: Array of arrays, an array for each node, where the arrays containes the neighbors

     above graph can be represented as:

     graph = [[1, 3], [0, 2, 3], [1, 3], [0, 1, 2]]

     * advantage: storage efficient for sparse matrices, e.g. navigation graphs
     
     an elegant pythonic code for a looping over all neighbours of all nodes:

     ```python
     for node, neighbors in enumerate(graph): # looping over all nodes
      for neighbor in neighbors:
         ... # do something interesting
     ```

#### Calculating the Transpose of a Graph

This means reversing all nodes. 

- for undirected graphs: $G^T = G \Rightarrow A^T = A, \text{graph}^T = \text{graph}$ (graph is the adjacency list representation)
- for directed graphs: $A_{G^T} = A_G^T$ (for adjacency matrix, tranpose it.)
  Below we give how to tranpose the adjacency list representation of a graph:

  ```python
  def tranpose_graph(graph): 
   gt = [[] for i in graph]
   for node, neighbors in enumerate(graph) :
      for neighbor in neighbors :
         gt[neighbor].append(node) # reverse edges
   return gt
  ```

#### Traversing Graphs

Visiting all nodes (or a subset of all nodes) in a specific order.

* Basics:
   * **Depth First Search (DFS)**: first traverse the depth, and then move to other neighbors
   * **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: First visit all neighbors and then go to the deeper level
* Advanced:
  * shortest path (dijkstra shortest path, A*-Alg): visit nodes in an increasing weight order


##### DFS

implementation:

```python
def dfs(graph, start_node):
   visited = [False] * len(graph)
   def visit(node):
      if visited[node] return # node is already visited, do nothing
      visited[node] = True # register the visit
      print("discovered", node)
      for neighbor in graph[node]:
         visit[neighbor]
      print("finished", node)
   visit[start_node]
```


* **Example**: 

![dfs-example](./imgs/w12/dfs-example.png){width="85%"}

recursive implementation is elegant, but for large graphs stack depth (overflow) can be reached very easily, e.g. for graphs with thousands of nodes.
But it is possible to re-write any recursive algorithm iteratively using stack data structure, and this is what we can do for DFS - we can implement it
using stack data structure:

**stack implementation**:

```python
from collections import deque # simultaneously a stack and a queue
def dfs(graph, start_node):
   d = deque()
   d.append(start_node)
   visited = [False] * len(graph)
   while len(d) != 0 : # there are still elements in the stack
      node = d.popright() # LIFO (for BFS we will simply replace with popleft)
      if visited[node]: continue
      visited[node] = True
      print("discovered", node)
      for neighbor in graph[node]:
         d.append(neighbor)
```
   
`print("finished", node)` is now not in post-order. As indicated in the comment above, to get BFS instead of DFS the only necessary difference is 
to change `node = d.popright()` to `node = d.popleft()`. 


##### BFS

In BFS first all the neighbors are visited, and then the deeper levels. It means

- replacing stack witha  queue (or if a deque is used, replace popright() with popleft()).

### Applications of DFS and BFS

* Copying a graph: Depth search with pre-order traversal, copying a node as soon as a node is discovered
* Deleting a graph: DFS with post-order traversal
* detecting whether a graph is a tree. Graph is a tree $\Leftrightarrow$ there are no cycles
  * There is a cycle $\Rightarrow$  there exists a node that can be reached in multiple ways. 
  * A node is reached second time $\Rightarrow$ `visited[node]` Flag is already `True`
  * Trivial cycles are not considered as cycles: n -> m -> n is not a cycle
  * implementation:

    return `True`, is there is a cycle     

    ```python
    def undirected_cycle_test(graph): # graph given as adjecency list
      visited = [False] * len(graph)
      def visit(node, parent):
         if not visited[node]: # no cycle
            visited[node] = True
            for neighbor in gaph[node]:
               if neighbor == parent: continue # skip trivial cycles
               if visit(neighbor, node): 
                  return True
            return False
         else: return True
      return visit(0, None)
    ```

#### 8 Queens Problem

Simplification: 4x4 chessboard with 4 queens. 

![8 queens](./imgs/w12/8-queens.png){width="75%"}

Each square is a node. 

Above graph is represented as:

```
graph = [[1, 2, 3, 4],
         [7, 8],
         [8], ...]
```

Assume that we have a function `check_capture(queens)`
solved queens: list of nodes, where the 


Solution using depth search:

```python
def place_queens(graph): 
   queens = []
   def visit(node, queens):
      if node == 17: return True # solution found
      queens.append(node) # 
      if check_capture(queens[1:]): # 
         def queens[-1]
         return False
      for neighbor in graph[node]:
         if visit[neighbor, queens]: return True
      del queens[-1]
      return False
      if visit(0, queens): return queens[1:]
      else: return None
```

only a single solution is found with this implementation.

All solutions

```python
def place_quuens(graph):
   solutions = []
   queens = []
   def visit(node, queens):
      if node == 17:
         solutions.append(queens[-1])
         return
      queens.append(node)
      if not check_capture(queens[1:]): # valid partial solution
         for neightobr in graph[node]:
            visit(neighbor, queens)
      del queens[-1] # backtracking towards the next solution
   visit(0, queens)
```

#### Searching and Identifying Connected Components

* a graph is connected, if $\forall u, v \in V$ there is a path $u \rightsquigarrow v$
* if the graph is not connected: $C \subset G$ is a connected component, if $C$ is connected and 
  $\forall u \in V \\ C \neg u \rightsquigarrow C$
