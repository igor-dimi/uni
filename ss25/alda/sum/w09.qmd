### Search Trees (Cont.)

* complexity of the tree-search: 
  * T(tree) = O(number of comparisons)
  * number of comparisons = length of the path from the root to the target, or "not found"
* extreme cases: 
  * **degenerate tree**: all nodes have at most one child $\Rightarrow$ the tree is a linear list $\Rightarrow$ O(N)
  * **complete tree**: 
    * first we define depth of a node as the length of the path from the root to the node. 
    * then a complete tree is defined as a tree s.t.
      * every non-leaf node has two children
      * all nodes that have the same depth have the same amount of children
      * $\Rightarrow$ $N = 2^d - 1$, O(d) = O(log(N))

* **sentinel**: 
  * obervation: all invalid (empty) children point to None
  * idea: insert `None` as an actual node, a so-called "sentinel" in the graph:

![sentinel](./imgs/w09/sentinel.png){width="75%"}

  * RS-path (root-sentinel path): any path from root to None (sentinel)
    * m := min(|RS|)
    * M := max(|RS|)

* given these, the definition of a complete tree can be simplified as a tree s.t. m = M
* **perfect balanced tree**: M <= m + 1, or nodes with less than two children only in the last or forelast levels

![perfectly-balanced](./imgs/w09/perfectly-balanced.png){width="55%"}

* search in worst case does M - 1 comparisons which is approx log(N). 
* In order for the tree-search to be efficient, the balance sof the tree should be preserved during the insert / remove operations
* Oldest idea: AVL-trees - always pefectly balanced, but this is complicated and actually **unneccesary**.
* We weaken the condition of **perfectly** balanced and instead only require balanced $\Rightarrow$ 
  Number of comparisons = M - 1 = k * log(N), where k >= 1 is a constant that is independent from N. 

#### Data Structures for Balanced Trees (Not Necessarily Perfect)

* Red-Black Trees: standard implementation
* Anderson Trees: simplification of Red-Black Trees, later
* Treap: combination with priority search-trees, i.e. Heaps
  * Heaps are trees where the the least or largest element are searched. 

##### Fundamental Operation: Rotation

* Goal: a simple re-structuring of the tree s.t. 
  1. search-tree condition is preserved
  2. balance is improved (M - m is reduced, or at least doesn't get larger, because sometimes multiple subsequent rotations are necessary)
* Two types of rotation: 
  * RS-path of the left sub-tree is longer $\Rightarrow$ right-rotation
  * RS-path of the right sub-tree is longer $\Rightarrow$ left-rotation

![rotatoin](./imgs/w09/rotation.png){width="75%"}

* naive idea is the simply assign "5" as the new root, but this won't always work when new node is inserted, but the core idea is stil correct
  immediately

* let's consider a general situation:

![general rotation](./imgs/w09/rotation-2.png){width="75%"}

* advantage of rotation: local operation: you only have to 'know' the root and its children, not the whole tree
* implementation:

```python
def tree_rotate_right(node):
    new_root = node.left
    node.left = new_root.right
    new_root.right = node
    return new_root # inform Roots parent aboaut change

def tree_rotate_left(node):
    new_root = node.right
    node.right = new_root.left
    new_root.left = node
    return new_root
```

* we haven't yet implemented when and where the rotation is performed, only how. Various implementations of Red-black Tree address this 
  in different ways. We will come to this later

##### Anderson Trees

* differnetiate between horizontal and vertical edges 
* only right children can be connected horizontally
* two horizontal edges can follow each other subsequently

![anderson-tree](./imgs/w09/anderson-tree.png){width="85%"}

* if we include only the vertical edges wenn calculating the length of the RS-paths then min(|RS|) = max(|RS|), which is virtually
  perfectly balanced
* the "actual" depth is at most twice as much as the "virtual" / "effective" one, since at most every 2nd edge horizontal the factor 2 is 
  absorbed in O().
