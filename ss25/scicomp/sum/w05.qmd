## Lecture 5 - 13.05.25

* associative containers - ordered and unordered
* companion classes - 
  * `std::pair`, 
  * `std::tuple`, 
  * `std::variant`, 
  * `std::any`, 
  * `std::optional`
* using companion classes instead of custom structs is also advantagous due to **structured bindings**
* smart pointers
  * unique pointer
  * shared pointer
  * weak pointer
* lambda expressions and closures
  * lambda expressoins in c++ are syntactical sugar for functors
